      "\n",
      "* **Gravity Gone Wild:** Because all that matter is packed so tightly, it creates an *incredibly* strong gravitational pull. Gravity is what keeps us on Earth, and black holes have so much gravity that *nothing*, not even light, can escape once it gets too close.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **The Event Horizon:** This is the “point of no return” around a black hole. Think of it like a waterfall – once you go over the edge, there's no getting back up.  The event horizon is the boundary around the black hole where the gravity is so strong that nothing can escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **They're Not Vacuum Cleaners:**  Black holes don’t just suck everything up! You have to get pretty close to the event horizon to be pulled in. If our Sun suddenly turned into a black hole (which it won't!), Earth would still orbit it just like it does now.\n",
